WEB DESIGN
    Display a role object from the roles.json inside a card for the player to see. 
    Decide if you're doing a mobile design or not, since the screen can easily get cluttered, we might want to instruct people to connect via PC and NOT mobile

    Get the list of usernames from each connections from the server and display in another card 
        The list should only display the usernames of alive players
        Next to their names should be a hidden space for buttons to load
            In day, display a vote button in that space once the voting phase has begun
            Once someone has made their plea after being voted, display guilty and innocent in the beginning of the screen
            In night, all roles that have a night ability, display a select button in that space
